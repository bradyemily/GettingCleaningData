# README

The script run_analysis.R takes 6 observational data files and combines them into one single dataset. Two additional datasets are used to clean the data and make it more readable to users. The script writes the final tidy data set to a text file.

The final data gives information about the subject, the activity they were doing whule observed, and the average measurements associated with the observations.

Detailed descriptions of each step in the script can be found in the Code Book
